# Java 8 Features Practice

## Overview
This project is a collection of programs and examples demonstrating various features introduced in Java 8. The main objective is to provide hands-on practice with Java 8â€™s powerful enhancements, covering essential concepts programmatically.

## Features Covered
- **Lambda Expressions**: Utilizes lambda expressions for cleaner and more concise code.
- **Functional Interfaces**: Explores Java's built-in functional interfaces (`Predicate`, `Consumer`, `Function`, `Supplier`) along with custom implementations.
- **Stream API**: Provides examples for stream operations such as filtering, mapping, sorting, reducing, and collecting.
- **Optional Class**: Demonstrates handling optional values to prevent `NullPointerException`.
- **Date and Time API**: Employs the `java.time` package for improved date and time handling.
- **Default and Static Methods in Interfaces**: Highlights how interfaces in Java 8 can now include default and static methods.
- **Method References**: Uses method references for more readable code.
- **Collectors and Parallel Streams**: Introduces advanced stream operations, including result collection and parallel processing for performance.

## About
All examples are focused on Java 8 features and implemented programmatically to help understand the concepts practically.

This project serves as a quick reference and practice tool for Java 8's key features, catering to developers looking to deepen their understanding of these enhancements.
